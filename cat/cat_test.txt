 Who do  e	sn't love music? Whatever mood we have â€“ bad or good, from time to time we turn on our favorite song. And it, in turn, either calms us, or on the contrary, makes us fall into melancholy.

Life without music would be boring and dull. Just imagine a disco being in silence or holidays being without musicians. Absolutely all people of every type around the world are not indifferent to the music. 
Genres that are most popular are rock, rap, pop, techno, chanson, hip-hop and others. There are other very specific genres. 
For example, folk music, classical music, spiritual music and also such interesting genres as blues and jazz.

        Have you ever noticed that people, who share your tastes in music, get along with you much faster than those whose tastes are very different from yours? 
Many people believe that music is first and foremost an instrument of the soul. Probably it is so.

Most of all I like modern music, but I also will not refuse to listen to classical and ethnic music. For example, I like Spanish folk songs. 
Listening to foreign songs I improve my knowledge of English. This is a great way to mix business with pleasure.
